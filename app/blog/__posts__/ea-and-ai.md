# Enterprise Architecture in the Age of AI

Enterprise Architecture (EA) has always been about aligning business and technology. But the introduction of AI is fundamentally changing what it means to architect enterprise solutions.

## The Shift

Traditional EA focused on:
- Systems integration
- Process optimization
- Information management
- Risk mitigation

Today, architects must also consider:
- AI governance and explainability
- Data quality and bias mitigation
- Model lifecycle management
- Ethical implications of automation

## Key Considerations

### Data as a Strategic Asset

AI systems are fundamentally different from traditional systems. They don't just process data - they learn from it. This means:

1. **Data governance** becomes critical
2. **Quality over quantity** matters more than ever
3. **Privacy and compliance** must be architected in from the start

### Governance Models

Organizations need clear governance for:
- Which AI solutions to build vs. buy
- How to manage model versions
- Approval workflows for production deployment
- Monitoring and performance tracking

## Practical Steps

1. **Audit current systems** for AI readiness
2. **Define AI governance** principles
3. **Invest in data infrastructure**
4. **Build AI-literate teams**
5. **Start with pilot projects**

The architects who succeed will be those who can bridge the gap between business needs and technical possibilities.
